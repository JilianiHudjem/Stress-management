# Stress-management
This project aims to help people who struggles with stress, specially the one caused by hard working, and are looking for ways to deal with that.

"Stress is an automatic physical, mental and emotional response to a difficult event" - States the Mayo Clinic. [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stress-management/about/pac-20384898] Stress is actually a disease, the illness of the XXI century.  

Cientifically Stress is triggered by the perception of a challenging, threatening or demanding situation by the brain. This can range from an imminent physical danger to an emotional or cognitive demand. When the brain perceives the stressor stimulus, it sends signals to the autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic functions of the body, such as heart rate, breathing, blood pressure and hormone release.

The autonomic nervous system responds by activating two main divisions:

The sympathetic nervous system, preparing the body for the action of fight or flight, increasing the heart rate, dilating the bronchi, releasing glucose in the blood and diverting blood flow to the muscles.
The parasympathetic nervous system, which helps the body to return to its state of balance after the response to stress, promoting the deceleration of body functions.

Stress can be reflected in diverse parts of your life, even in your social relationships as at home and in the workplace. You may lose patience while taking to your coworkers, your stakeholders, your family members or your friends, and they will notice it.

There are some tips based on the Bible you can considerate:

- Try to give yourself some downtime, and get adequate rest and balanced recreation. The Bible says: “Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.”—Ecclesiastes 4:6.

- Set sound priorities, and adopt a modest lifestyle. (Philippians 1:10) Consider simplifying your life, perhaps by reducing expenses or time spent at work.—Luke 21:34, 35.

The Bible can also give aid to cope with stress in the workplace. See what it says:

  - When someone upsets you, try to stay calm. Do not add fuel to the fire. “A mild answer turns away rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger,” says Proverbs 15:1
  - Try to settle differences privately and respectfully, thus dignifying the other person.— Matthew 5:23-25
  - Try to gain insight into his or her feelings and viewpoint. Such insight “slows down [our] anger” because it puts us in the other person’s shoes. (Proverbs 19:11) It 
    can also help us to see ourselves through the other person’s eyes
  - Try to forgive. Forgiveness is not only beautiful. It is also good medicine. As reported in a 2001 study, “unforgiving thoughts” resulted in “significantly higher” 
    blood pressure and heart rate, whereas a forgiving attitude reduced stress.—Colossians 3:13.

Stress can damage and control our lives if we do not learn how to control it. It is veryy important to take the right "medicine" to cope with this "disease". The Bible, besides a religious book, can effectively help anyone in any difficult situation. But, if you have chronical stress do not forget to talk to your doctor about your mental illness. You may need some psychological support.
